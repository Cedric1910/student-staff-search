Feasibility Study


Practicality: 

This application provides a solution to the problem of connecting students and lecturers for research projects. With our approach, the application is practical to develop within the time frame and with the resources provided.


Technical: 

For our database management system (DBMS) our project team will incorporate H2, which will primarily act as the back-end of the database which will hold the details of students and lecturers. HTML/CSS will be used to create the front-end and website display
•HTML/CSS for front-end view of the site. 


•Some sort of middleman, ideally javaScript to Java to connect the front and back end together. 




The majority of us are familiar with Java, which we plan to use to design the backend. The member of the team who is unfamiliar with Java is well versed in front end tools. Three members are well versed in H2 for the database. Overall, the team is well prepared to use these tools to create the intended product. There may be some time and resources spent to counsel each other on the skills some of us do not know.  


Operations: 

Application will operate as a web service. The student will give information on what they want to study, and the web service should always return a list of ideal faculty members that they should contact. Hypothetically a connection to the Otago Universities Staff Database to get up-to-date information about the staff faculty that want to partner with PhD students. Also, if we could gain secure access, the student and staff evision log in portal would be ideal for login to the website, rather than having the users create new accounts. Being linked to Evision, the University of Otago IT department would be responsible for the future maintenance of this system.


Schedule: 

We estimate that the product could be created within the three iterations, with a finished product at the end of the semester. Between 5 people, over the course of 3 sprints, we could create a front end, backend/database and effectively integrate the two pieces, for a finished page of professor profiles that student users can filter. Ideally, if schedule permits, we will be able to also add robust student profiles and an elegant system for professors to approve contact. 



Resource: 

Time: We will collaborate on gitbucket, meaning that we can all work on different parts of the application at the same time. Additionally, we can work on the project from home etc., which allows us to spend extra time on finishing projects and sprints.


Money: We won’t be getting paid.


NetBeans supports the use of multiple programming languages into one platform, which provides an efficient way to manage and interact with all aspects of the system. This platform also incorporates version control services and developer testing.


GitBucket provides a platform for us to push/pull/commit our versions of work into a centralised repository which we can all create the final product out of. 


Exercise from Class (lecture 2):
•potential stakeholders : lecturers, students


•Two functional reqs: login with id and password, filtering a search, professors post their fields, two separate user interfaces


•Two non-functional reqs: fast response time, accessible user interface, security precautions



•As a student user I want a filtering mechanism so that my search is more efficient to find a lecturer relevant to my research.


•As a student user, I want a simple and usable interface so that actions and navigation is straightforward.


•As a student user, I want a streamlined interface so that I can reach out to lecturers in a quick and easy way.


•As a lecturer user I want to post a profile so that I gain exposure to students.


•As a lecturer user I want a contact request system so that I can predetermine what students I am interested in working with.


•As a lecturer user I want good security so that my information is kept private and secure.
